# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS


   For the first ten pages of the basics of HTML and CSS, I've read through some new coding that I think could help me increase my coding literacy. One of the few elements
   are the strong emphasis, quotations, and many others. There's is one that I favor the most that will make a website neat and organized are line breaks & horizontal rules on page 48. Reading through the CSS style, I learn more about how to use it in HTML more efficently than by learning with someone who has prior experience to coding. With the use of CSS, I  can enhance my creativity with any website I can build.
   
   As I read through the basics of JavaScript, learning about variables were one of the first few steps of how to code on JavaScript. With the use of JavaScript, I can enhance my coding on another level! There are many other ways to use Javascript, that there re some I didn't know about! It can also be used in away as similar to html when using titles, and creating structures to a website. I have a lot to learn with this new skill, especially if the website requires me to interact with others.
